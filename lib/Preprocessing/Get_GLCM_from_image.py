grayValue is matrix of Grayscale picture
m_grayMatrix is Gray scale co-occurrence matrix generated by gray matrix
and this functiuon will return the Gray scale co-occurence matrix and the count of point

gray matrix to Gray scale co-occurrence matrix have deffent direction
like 0 degrees ,45 degrees
We can calculate the gray-order co-occurence matrix in 360 degrees, 
and we can calculate the gray scale co-occurence matrix of more than 1 distances according to the distance provided, 
but the default is 1.
